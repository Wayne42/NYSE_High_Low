## Generate them yourself
You can generate the most recent output files yourself with my script using node.js.
To do that you need to find the most recent [NYSE ticker list](https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/stock) and then download all the recent input files from [Yahoo Finance](https://de.finance.yahoo.com/).

## TODO
Data may not be accurate enough, because new stocks get listed and delisted every day.  
To improve the results, one would additionally need to get the listing and delisting dates.
